# For this project, I obtained Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Afterward, I set up a table to input the Spotify data.
# Lastly, I utilized SQL to carry out analysis on the data.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Then, I added the Spotify Data from the .csv file into the table.

# Following that, I investigated the data using the subsequent SQL queries.


1. Question: What is the average popularity of tracks in the dataset?

SELECT AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity FROM Spotifydata;

2. Question: Which artist has the most tracks in the dataset?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) AS track_count FROM Spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name ORDER BY track_count DESC LIMIT 1;

3. Question: What is the average duration of tracks for each artist?

SELECT artist_name, AVG(duration_ms) AS avg_duration FROM Spotifydata GROUP BY artist_name ORDER BY avg_duration DESC;

4. Question: What is the distribution of track duration (in milliseconds)?

SELECT FLOOR(duration_ms / 60000) AS duration_minutes, COUNT(*) AS track_count FROM Spotifydata GROUP BY duration_minutes ORDER BY duration_minutes;
